# Dietary Analysis

Dietary analysis is based upon a Workbook that allows you to enter details of a recipe or meal, and to see the quantity of key nutritional variables that it contains.

The workbook contains a number of worksheets where common foodstuffs are collected under headings; for example, *Meat,Fish,Poultry,Eggs* and *Principal Salad_Raw Veg*.

Open the workbook and enter quantity (in grams or, in the case of condiments, in tablespoons). This will show against the item, the quantity of Carbs etc. that the item represents.

When you  have entered all of the items for your recipe or meal you are able to get an analysis that summarises all of the items. To do this, go to the [Harmony Life Plan web site]<https://www.harmonylifeplan.com/>, navigate to *Your Harmony* and log in. In the *Your Harmony* page you will see a menu item (link) for *Process analysis file*.
